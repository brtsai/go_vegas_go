Basically https://github.com/AndrewLien/Vegas_Events_API but in Golang

API that scrapes https://electronic.vegas/vegas-edm-event-calendar/ and returns
Vegas EDM events by dates specified in the request

Caveat: Not fully functional, will scrape and parse, but functionality for saving to mongodb is lacking

Additional features
    Check twitter for profile picture if applicable?
